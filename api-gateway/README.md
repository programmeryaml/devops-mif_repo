Project Title
This README provides instructions on how to use decK to manage Kong configurations declaratively. We use two main directories: deck for adding services and routes, and plugins for adding plugins.

Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

Kong
decK
Directory Structure
deck/: Contains declarative configuration files for services and routes.
plugins/: Contains configuration files for plugins.
Setup
Install Kong: Follow the official Kong installation guide.

Install decK: Refer to the decK installation instructions.

How to Use
Adding Services and Routes
Navigate to the deck/ directory.

Create or modify the YAML configuration files for your services and routes. Refer to the Kong Declarative Configuration format for guidance.

Apply the configuration using decK:

sh
Copy code
deck sync -s <service_configuration_file>.yml
Adding Plugins
Navigate to the plugins/ directory.

Create or modify the YAML configuration files for your plugins, ensuring they match the structure required by Kong.

To apply the plugin configurations to your Kong instance, use:

sh
Copy code
deck sync -s <plugin_configuration_file>.yml
Best Practices
Keep your configuration files version-controlled to track changes over time.
Test your configurations in a staging environment before applying them to production.
Regularly update both Kong and decK to their latest versions to take advantage of new features and bug fixes.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter errors during the deck sync process, verify the syntax and completeness of your YAML files.
Ensure Kong is running and accessible from where you're executing decK commands.
For detailed error information, use the --verbose flag with decK commands.
